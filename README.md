Create a programm for calculating invertible matrix using cofactors in multithreading mode. The number of threads/proccesses and size of a matrix can be choosen by user.
Data structure: square matrix
Dimensions: 10^3 - 10^4 elements
## Algorithms
-----
Since cofactor of an element ___a___ of a matrix ___A___ is a determinant of some smaller square matrix, cut down from ___A___ by removing one of its rows and columns, multiplied by -1 if element is placed in row _i_ and column _j_ and _i+j_ is an odd number, the programm should be used an efficient algorithm for calculating determinant. For these projects the Bareiss Algorithm was implemented, 'cause of its efficiency and simplicity.
